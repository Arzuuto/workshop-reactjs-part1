# Exercises :pencil:

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:
- app.js: represents the entry file for the exercise.
- README.md: contains exercise instructions.
- test.js: you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.

## How to start coding,

Install some plugins
```shell
learnpack plugins:install learnpack-react
```

Then start the application
```shell
learnpack start
```

When you build your code, if a site don't show up you can enter yhis link in your web browser:
http://localhost:3000/preview/
